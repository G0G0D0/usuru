    <h1>The Paradox of Love</h1>
    <p>
      What I’m saying is that it has no beginning and no end. It’s a paradox in which you’re stuck—an inescapable prison where no matter how far you go, you’ll end up exactly where you started. Thinking that we both can fight and not talk to each other is a mere illusion given by the liberty of love. You’re stabbed by my knife—if you pull out, you’ll die. If

        u keep it inside u for so long u gonna die either . The only way for u to survive is to stop time . I can do that for u. All u have to do is stfu and stick with me forever. Like I said before who knows, that paati might be a time traveller who orchestrated my accident jus for me to be idle and post stories so that you’ll see it and talk to me . <a href="second.html">Millions</a>      </p>
    <!-- <p>
      So, my love, let us embrace the beauty of this paradox. Let us revel in the knowledge that no matter the twists and turns, we are fated to be together. Like magnets drawn inexorably towards each other, our love is an unbreakable bond that defies logic and reason <a href="second.html">if</a>.
